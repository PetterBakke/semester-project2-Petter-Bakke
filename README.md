Semester Project 2

Description: 

In this Semester Project I created an e-commerce website with Strapi. It has to be fully responsive. The design should follow modern patterns and be good-looking. 

User side:
This website should contain:
homepage: A hero banner with an image that is uploaded to strapi. A list of featured products which can be marked on Strapi.

product-list:  A list of all products added to Strapi. Each product must display title, price and image. It should link to it's detail page. A search text box. When searching (filtering), only the products that include the searched text in their title or description should be listed.

product-detail: when clicking on a product it will redirect you to the details page. On this page the following will be displayed: title, description, image, price and add to cart button.

cart: The cart should display all the products that are put into the cart. With use of localStorage the products will be loaded into the cart and also saved. If the cart is empty it should display a message indicating this. Each product in the cart should display the following: title, price, image and a link to it's detail page. The total price of the cart should also be displayed. 

Admin side: 
A login form for the admin. Localstorage to keep the admin logged in. A logout button that will log out the admin and redirect to homepage. There are forms to let the admin add, update and delete products with the use of URL.
